chore: organize experimentation artifacts into experiments/ directory

- Move benchmark scripts to experiments/scripts/ (tracked)
- Move analysis reports to experiments/benchmarks/reports/ (tracked)
- Move transient results to experiments/benchmarks/results/ (gitignored)
- Move generated configs to experiments/configs/ (gitignored)
- Update .gitignore to track important files, ignore transient data
- Add experiments/README.md documenting structure
- Add docs/PARALLELIZATION_TESTING.md for testing methodology

This organization keeps the repository clean while preserving important
benchmark tools and analysis documents. Transient data can be regenerated
from the tracked scripts.

Summary of changes:
- 4 scripts tracked (benchmark_scalability, generate_scalable_synthetic_laz, profile_parallel_overhead, test_parallelization)
- 4 analysis reports tracked (PARALLELIZATION_ANALYSIS, BENCHMARK_RESULTS, NEXT_STEPS, BENCHMARK_IN_PROGRESS)
- 17 transient files gitignored (3 result files, 14 config files)
- Root directory cleaned of experimental clutter
