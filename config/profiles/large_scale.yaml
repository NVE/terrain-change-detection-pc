# Configuration profile for large-scale out-of-core processing
#
# Use this profile for datasets that are too large to fit in memory.
# This enables:
# - Streaming data loading (never loads full datasets)
# - Tiled change detection processing
# - File-based alignment transformations
# - Memory-efficient workflows
#
# Usage: uv run scripts/run_workflow.py --config config/profiles/large_scale.yaml
